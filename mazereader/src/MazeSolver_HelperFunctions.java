/**
 * Compilation: javac MazeSolver_HelperFunctions.java
 * Execution: N/A
 *
 * This file is not meant to be run independently. Place this file in the same directory as your MazeSolver.java
 * and call these functions using the dot notation -- for example, MazeSolver_HelperFunctions.visualizeDistances() --
 * or copy and paste these functions into your MazeSolver.java file, citing the original author in their JavaDocs.
 *
 * Note that these functions also use ImageFilter.dispalyImage(), so it will be helpful to include that file in your
 * working director as well. Can you think of any other functions from Labs 01 - 03 that might come in handy?
 *
 * IMPORTANT:   If these functions are incompatible with your implementation, that's OK!
 *              You are welcome to modify these functions as you see fit!
 *              These specific implementations are not strict project requirements. They are provided only to
 *              help you reduce development & debugging time by taking care of some the heavy lifting that is useful
 *              for the program but not essential to Lab 04's primary learning objectives: 2D structures & objects.
